# Repo Description

## Centralized algorithms for movielens and dblp:
(i) centralized_greedy_movies.py this code is used to run and generate centralized greedy algorithm for MovieLens
(ii) centralized_greedy.py this code is used to run and generate centralized greedy algorithm for DBLP

## Algorithm 1 codes:
(i) partial_participation_federated_dblp_lowbit_proportionate.py this code is used to run the results in algorithm for various k and d combinations on DBLP dataset
(ii) partial_participation_partial_low_bit_change_obj_movies.py this code is used to run the results in algorithm for various k and d combinations on MovieLens dataset

## Algorithm 2 codes:
(i) low_round_movielens.py this code is used to run the results in algorithm for various k and d combinations on movielens data
